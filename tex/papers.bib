abstract = {In today's web, it is not uncommon for web applications to take a complete URL as
input from users. Usually, once the web application receives a URL, the server opens
a connection to it. However, if the URL points to an internal service and the server
still makes the connection, the server becomes vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery
(SSRF) attacks. These attacks can be highly destructive when they exploit internal
services. They are equally destructive and need much less effort to succeed if the
server is hosted in a cloud environment. Therefore, with the growing use of cloud
computing, the threat of SSRF attacks is becoming more serious.In this paper, we present
a novel defense approach to protect internal services from SSRF attacks. Our analysis
of more than 60 SSRF vulnerability reports shows that developers' awareness about
this vulnerability is generally limited. Therefore, coders usually have flaws in their
defenses. Even when these defenses have no flaws, they are usually still affected
by important security and functionality limitations. In this work, we develop a prototype
based on the proposed approach by extending the functionality of a popular reverse
proxy application and deploy a set of vulnerable web applications with that prototype.
We demonstrate how SSRF attacks on these applications, with almost no loss of performance,
are prevented.},

  abstract =   {Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder   variants with impressive results being obtained in several areas, mostly   on vision and language datasets.  The best results obtained on supervised   learning tasks often involve an unsupervised learning component, usually   in an unsupervised pre-training phase. The main question investigated   here is the following: why does unsupervised pre-training work so well?   Through extensive experimentation, we explore several possible   explanations discussed in the literature including its action as a   regularizer (Erhan et al. 2009) and as an aid to optimization   (Bengio et al. 2007).  Our results build on the work of   Erhan et al. 2009, showing that unsupervised pre-training appears to   play predominantly a regularization role in subsequent supervised   training. However our results in an online setting, with a virtually unlimited   data stream, point to a somewhat more nuanced interpretation of the roles   of optimization and regularization in the unsupervised pre-training   effect.}

TITLE = {An LSTM-Based Deep Learning Approach for Classifying Malicious Traffic at the Packet Level},
JOURNAL = {Applied Sciences},
VOLUME = {9},
YEAR = {2019},
NUMBER = {16},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to network security assessments and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) with various breakthroughs such as using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to classify malicious traffic. However, these state-of-the-art systems also face tremendous challenges to satisfy real-time analysis requirements due to the major delay of the flow-based data preprocessing, i.e., requiring time for accumulating the packets into particular flows and then extracting features. If detecting malicious traffic can be done at the packet level, detecting time will be significantly reduced, which makes the online real-time malicious traffic detection based on deep learning technologies become very promising. With the goal of accelerating the whole detection process by considering a packet level classification, which has not been studied in the literature, in this research, we propose a novel approach in building the malicious classification system with the primary support of word embedding and the LSTM model. Specifically, we propose a novel word embedding mechanism to extract packet semantic meanings and adopt LSTM to learn the temporal relation among fields in the packet header and for further classifying whether an incoming packet is normal or a part of malicious traffic. The evaluation results on ISCX2012, USTC-TFC2016, IoT dataset from Robert Gordon University and IoT dataset collected on our Mirai Botnet show that our approach is competitive to the prior literature which detects malicious traffic at the flow level. While the network traffic is booming year by year, our first attempt can inspire the research community to exploit the advantages of deep learning to build effective IDSs without suffering significant detection delay.},

monitoring and control technologies, including the widely used Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The growing interconnection of these systems
with corporate networks exposes them to cyber attacks, with several security incidents
reported over the last few decades. This study provides a classification scheme for
categorising security incidents related to critical infrastructure and industrial
control systems. The classification scheme is applied to analyse 242 security incidents
on critical infrastructure and industrial control networks, which were reported between
1982 and 2014. The results show interesting patterns, with key points highlighted
for the purpose of improving the way we plan for and direct efforts toward protecting
critical infrastructure and industrial networks.},

  abstract =   {Despite the great advances made by deep learning in many machine learning problems, there is a relative dearth of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection. Those approaches which do exist involve networks trained to perform a task other than anomaly detection, namely generative models or compression, which are in turn adapted for use in anomaly detection; they are not trained on an anomaly detection based objective. In this paper we introduce a new anomaly detection method—Deep Support Vector Data Description—, which is trained on an anomaly detection based objective. The adaptation to the deep regime necessitates that our neural network and training procedure satisfy certain properties, which we demonstrate theoretically. We show the effectiveness of our method on MNIST and CIFAR-10 image benchmark datasets as well as on the detection of adversarial examples of GTSRB stop signs.}

abstract = {For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding
the rare instances or the outliers, can be more interesting than finding the common
patterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary
property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful
to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local
outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated
the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal
analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets,
we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful,
but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance
evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers
can be practical.},

However, research on anomaly detection systems for industrial networks suffers from the lack of suitable training data to verify the methods at early stages. This paper presents a framework and workflow to generate meaningful training and test data for anomaly detection systems in industrial settings. Using process-model based simulations data can be generated on a large scale. We evaluate the data in regard to its usability for state-of-the-art anomaly detection systems. With adequate simulation configurations, it is even possible to simulate a sensor manipulation attack on the model and to derive labeled data.",

abstract = {Anomalous events that affect the performance of networks are a fact of life. It is
therefore not surprising that recent years have seen an explosion in research on network
anomaly detection. What is quite surprising, however, is the lack of controlled evaluation
of these detectors. In this paper we argue that there are numerous important questions
regarding the effectiveness of anomaly detectors that cannot be answered by the evaluation
techniques employed today. We present four central requirements of a rigorous evaluation
that can only be met by simulating both the anomaly and its surrounding environment.
While simulation is necessary, it is not sufficient. We therefore present an outline
of an evaluation methodology that leverages both simulation and traces from operational
networks},

  abstract      = {Feature extraction becomes increasingly important as data grows high dimensional. Autoencoder as a neural network based feature extraction method achieves great success in generating abstract features of high dimensional data. However, it fails to consider the relationships of data samples which may affect experimental results of using original and new features. In this paper, we propose a Relation Autoencoder model considering both data features and their relationships. We also extend it to work with other major autoencoder models including Sparse Autoencoder, Denoising Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder. The proposed relational autoencoder models are evaluated on a set of benchmark datasets and the experimental results show that considering data relationships can generate more robust features which achieve lower construction loss and then lower error rate in further classification compared to the other variants of autoencoders.},

  abstract      = {A feature learning task involves training models that are capable of inferring good representations (transformations of the original space) from input data alone. When working with limited or unlabelled data, and also when multiple visual domains are considered, methods that rely on large annotated datasets, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), cannot be employed. In this paper we investigate different auto-encoder (AE) architectures, which require no labels, and explore training strategies to learn representations from images. The models are evaluated considering both the reconstruction error of the images and the feature spaces in terms of their discriminative power. We study the role of dense and convolutional layers on the results, as well as the depth and capacity of the networks, since those are shown to affect both the dimensionality reduction and the capability of generalising for different visual domains. Classification results with AE features were as discriminative as pre-trained CNN features. Our findings can be used as guidelines for the design of unsupervised representation learning methods within and across domains.},

  __markedentry = {[root:5]},
  abstract      = {Internet traffic classification has become more important with rapid growth of current Internet network and online applications. There have been numerous studies on this topic which have led to many different approaches. Most of these approaches use predefined features extracted by an expert in order to classify network traffic. In contrast, in this study, we propose a \emph{deep learning} based approach which integrates both feature extraction and classification phases into one system. Our proposed scheme, called "Deep Packet," can handle both \emph{traffic characterization} in which the network traffic is categorized into major classes (\eg, FTP and P2P) and application identification in which end-user applications (\eg, BitTorrent and Skype) identification is desired. Contrary to most of the current methods, Deep Packet can identify encrypted traffic and also distinguishes between VPN and non-VPN network traffic. After an initial pre-processing phase on data, packets are fed into Deep Packet framework that embeds stacked autoencoder and convolution neural network in order to classify network traffic. Deep packet with CNN as its classification model achieved recall of $0.98$ in application identification task and $0.94$ in traffic categorization task. To the best of our knowledge, Deep Packet outperforms all of the proposed classification methods on UNB ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset.},

While deep learning has shown success in fields such as image classification and natural language processing, its application for feature extraction on raw network packet data for intrusion detection is largely unexplored. In this paper we modify a Word2Vec approach, used for text processing, and apply it to packet data for automatic feature extraction. We call this approach Packet2Vec. For the classification task of benign versus malicious traffic on a 2009 DARPA network data set, we obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) between 0.988-0.996 and an AUC of the Precision/Recall curve between 0.604-0.667.},

Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},
