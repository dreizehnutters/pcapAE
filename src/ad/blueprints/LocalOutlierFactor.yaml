LocalOutlierFactor:
  n_neighbors: 20 # Number of neighbors to use by default for kneighbors queries. If n_neighbors is larger than the number of samples provided, all samples will be used.
  algorithm: auto # Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:
  leaf_size: 30 # Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree. This can affect the speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the nature of the problem.
  metric: minkowski # metric used for the distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn or scipy.spatial.distance can be used. cityblock | cosine | euclidean | l1 | l2 | manhattan | mahalanobis | minkowski | contamination: auto # 
  p: 2 # Parameter for the Minkowski metric from sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances. When p = 1, this is equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.
  contamination: 0.00001 # The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion of outliers in the data set. When fitting this is used to define the threshold on the scores of the samples. [0, 0.5].
  n_jobs: 1 # The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search
  novelty: True # By default, LocalOutlierFactor is only meant to be used for outlier detection (novelty=False). Set novelty to True if you want to use LocalOutlierFactor for novelty detection.
