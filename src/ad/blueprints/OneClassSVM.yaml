OneClassSVM:
  kernel: rbf # linear | poly | rbf | sigmoid
  degree: 8 # Degree of the polynomial kernel function (‘poly’). Ignored by all other kernels.
  gamma: scale # auto | scale
  coef0: 0.0 # Independent term in kernel function. It is only significant in ‘poly’ and ‘sigmoid’
  tol: 0.001 # Tolerance for stopping criterion.
  nu: 0.5 # An upper bound on the fraction of training errors and a lower bound of the fraction of support vectors. Should be in the interval (0, 1]. By default 0.5 will be taken.
  shrinking: True # Whether to use the shrinking heuristic.
  cache_size: 200 # Specify the size of the kernel cache (in MB)
  verbose: True # Enable verbose output.
  max_iter: -1 # Hard limit on iterations within solver, or -1 for no limit.
